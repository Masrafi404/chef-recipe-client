### First of all I created a json file according to the data of the requirement and then I created a server site.

### Added navbar and footer for each page and the login and register pages are conditionally created.

### I have created a website named Spicy in which I have loaded the data of 6 chefs from the server-side.

### Then I added two sections as I want, one is Services and the other is Slider.

### Clicking on view recipe from six chef data will take you to a new page where all the data of that individual chef will be displayed and the recipes will be shown in card form.
